<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am currently a PhD student in linguistics at Michigan State University. I am primarily interested in sociolinguistics and phonetics, but have also been interested in semantics and pragmatics. My current research project is looking at the sound changes in post-tonic /ten/ sequences in Michigan. I work as a graduate assistant for the MI Diaries project.</p>

<p>My current advisor is Dr. Betsy Sneller</p>
