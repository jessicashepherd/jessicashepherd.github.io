{{ About Me }}

{{ I am currently a PhD student in linguistics at Michigan State University. I am primarily interested in sociolinguistics and phonetics, but have also been interested in semantics and pragmatics. My current research project is looking at the sound changes in post-tonic /ten/ sequences in Michigan. I work as a graduate assistant for the MI Diaries project. }}

{{ My current advisor is Dr. Betsy Sneller. }}
