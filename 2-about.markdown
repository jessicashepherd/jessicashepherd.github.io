I am originally from Colorado. Before coming to MSU, I received my Bachelor's degree in Linguistics from Brigham Young University in Utah. I also received a certification to teach English to speakers of other languages. I worked as an English teacher in Utah for two years at the [English Language Center](https://elc.byu.edu/) at Brigham Young University. I loved getting to know the students there, who were from countries all around the world.

Outside of my research, I enjoy doing puzzles, baking, and spending time in nature (which is beautiful in Michigan!).
