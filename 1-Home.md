I am currently a PhD student in linguistics in the [Department of Linguistics, Languages, and Cultures](https://lilac.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University. I am primarily interested in sociolinguistics and phonetics, but have also been interested in semantics and pragmatics. Some specific interests within these fields are the phonetic and phonological variations that exist in language between different speech communities, how people use language to communicate meaning, and how language changes over time. I currently work with [Betsy Sneller](https://betsysneller.github.io/index.html), [Suzanne Wagner](https://wagnersu.msu.domains/), and [Karthik Durvasula](https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io/) to study these topics.

I currently work as a graduate assistant for the [MI Diaries](https://mi-diaries.org/) project. This project is working on documenting language change in Michigan through self-recorded audio diaries. 

My current research project is looking at the sound changes in post-tonic /t…ôn/ sequences, like in the words *button* and *mitten*, in Michigan. Specifically, I look at the realization of /t/ in this environment. Preliminary results suggest that speakers in Michigan are starting to use a flap more often, but I plan to confirm this through further research and more data collection in the coming months.
